* git credentials for private repos
  Add a command to bind git credentials to specific repos.
  Credentials should be stored locally, not in the rlgl server, and
  would be passed to the server for 'evaluate' runs.

* Export command
  Implement an export command that would generate a zip file
  containing report results, original report, policy, hash signature
  and public key.

* rekor integration
  Maybe we just need RFC3161 (eg. freetsa.org) support.
  The important part is proof-of-existance, which RFC3161 provides assuming
  you can trust the provider.

* Document Compression

  Compress all documents before hitting the storage driver, then serve
  the stored content up directly.
